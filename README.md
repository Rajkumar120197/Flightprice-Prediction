# Project Title: Flight Price Prediction and Analysis
# Objective:
The project aims to analyze a flight booking dataset obtained from the “Ease My Trip” website. The goal is to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests and use machine learning models, particularly Linear Regression, to predict flight ticket prices. The study provides valuable insights for passengers and airlines.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of flight details such as airline, departure and arrival times, stops, and travel duration. The key features include:

Airline: Categorical feature with six different airlines.

From: The departure city (six unique cities).

Departure Time: Categorized into six-time bins.

Stops: Number of stops between source and destination (categorical with three values).

Arrival Time: Categorized into six-time bins.

To: The destination city (six unique cities).

Time Taken: A continuous feature representing total travel time in hours.

# Workflow and Methodology:
# Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Checked for missing values and anomalies.

Categorical data encoding and feature engineering.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized distribution of flight prices.

Analyzed how different features affect price variations.

Identified correlations between variables.

# Statistical Hypothesis Testing:

Conducted tests to understand significant factors influencing ticket prices.

# Machine Learning Model Implementation:

Linear Regression was used as the primary model to predict ticket prices.

Feature selection was performed to optimize the model.

Model evaluation metrics were computed.

# Findings & Insights:

Flight prices are significantly impacted by airlines, stops, and travel duration.

Certain departure and arrival time bins have a noticeable effect on pricing.

The Linear Regression model provides meaningful predictions also improved using advanced ML techniques.

# Key Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
